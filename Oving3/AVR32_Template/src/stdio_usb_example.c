 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to configure a C-library Standard I/O interface
 * to the ASF Common usb_group Service.  The initialization routines, along with
 * board and clock configuration constants, illustrate how to perform serial I/O
 * via a Communication Device Class (CDC) device protocol.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - stdio_usb_example.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 * - conf_clock.h: board configuration
 * - stdio_usb.h: Common USB CDC Standard I/O Implementation
 * - read.c : System implementation function used by standard library
 * - write.c : System implementation function used by standard library
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR and AVR32 devices supported by the ASF Common USB Protocol can be
 * used. This example has been tested with the following:
 *   - UC3-A3 Xplained Evaluation kit
 *
 * \sa cdc_protocol_group
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 *   - Send message on USB CDC device to a Virtual Com Port.
 *   - Performs echo of any received character
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR and AVR32.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
